# Individualized Criminal and Eviction History Assessment Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes requirements for individualized review of criminal and eviction background information to ensure fair, compliant, and equitable tenant screening decisions. It applies to all team members involved in the screening workflow and to any tooling that supports application review.

## Scope
- All criminal background records, including arrests, convictions, and pending charges.
- All eviction history records, including filings, judgments, and settlements.
- Screening decisions rendered through the Tenant Screening App or related workflows.

## Policy Requirements

### 1. Case-by-Case Evaluation
1. All adverse findings must undergo individualized review before a decision is finalized.
2. Reviewers must consider the following contextual factors:
   - Nature and severity of the offense or eviction.
   - Time elapsed since the incident and applicant's age at the time.
   - Evidence of rehabilitation, such as completion of programs, employment stability, and positive rental references since the incident.
   - Mitigating circumstances (e.g., domestic violence, medical emergencies, wrongful eviction).
   - Relevance of the incident to the safety or property-related concerns of the housing provider.
3. Blanket bans based solely on the existence of criminal or eviction records are prohibited.
4. Any decision to proceed with adverse action must explicitly document why the individualized factors do not mitigate risk.

### 2. Applicant Engagement
1. Applicants must be provided the opportunity to submit supplemental documentation, correction requests, or context regarding the record in question.
2. Reviewers must allow at least five business days for applicants to respond before issuing a final adverse decision unless legal requirements dictate otherwise.
3. All supplemental information must be logged and attached to the application file for audit purposes.

## Procedures

### Individualized Assessment Workflow
1. **Initial Flagging**: The screening system flags records that require individualized review and routes them to a designated reviewer.
2. **Context Gathering**: Reviewers consult available data (screening reports, applicant statements, references) and request additional information if needed.
3. **Structured Assessment Notes**:
   - Summary of the record.
   - Contextual factors considered.
   - Evidence of rehabilitation or mitigating circumstances.
   - Final risk assessment and rationale.
4. **Decision Review**: A secondary reviewer or supervisor must sign off on adverse decisions involving discretionary judgment.

## Training and Tooling Requirements

### Staff Training Program
- **Curriculum**: Annual training covering fair housing obligations, individualized assessment techniques, documentation standards, and implicit bias mitigation.
- **Format**: Combination of instructor-led sessions and scenario-based e-learning modules.
- **Certification**: Staff must pass an assessment with a score of 85% or higher to be authorized to make adverse decisions.
- **Refresher Courses**: Semi-annual refreshers highlighting legal updates and lessons learned from audits.

### Workflow Tooling Updates
1. Update the Tenant Screening App review interface to include structured fields for individualized assessment notes (context, rehabilitation evidence, mitigating factors, final rationale).
2. Require completion of all structured fields before allowing submission of an adverse decision.
3. Capture reviewer identity, timestamps, and secondary reviewer approvals within the application.
4. Enable file uploads or links to supplemental documents provided by applicants.
5. Provide reporting dashboards to monitor completion of individualized assessment fields and training compliance.

## Audit and Recordkeeping
1. All assessment notes, supplemental documents, reviewer assignments, and decisions must be retained for a minimum of seven years or longer if required by law.
2. The system must generate immutable audit logs that include:
   - Application identifier and applicant name.
   - Timestamped record of each review action and decision.
   - Identity of the reviewer(s) and any supervisory approvals.
   - References to the individualized assessment notes.
3. For every adverse decision, export an audit packet containing the decision rationale, contextual factors considered, applicant communications, and any legal notices issued.
4. Conduct quarterly audits sampling at least 10% of adverse decisions to verify adherence to individualized assessment procedures.
5. Document audit findings, corrective actions, and follow-up timelines. Store these records with the corresponding audit packets.

## Compliance and Enforcement
- Non-compliance with this policy may result in remedial training, revocation of screening privileges, or disciplinary action.
- Policy effectiveness will be reviewed annually by the compliance team and updated to reflect changes in law or best practices.
