# Regional Screening Compliance Guide

This guide summarizes the statutory screening limits for the primary markets served by the tenant screening service. Use these notes alongside the automated policy toggles that now live in `src/lib/jurisdictions.ts`.

| Jurisdiction | Key Restrictions | Practical Configuration Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **California (Statewide)** | • SB 267 (2023) requires landlords to give Housing Choice Voucher holders an opportunity to present alternative credit evidence before denying an application.<br/>• Civil Code §1950.6 requires acceptance of reusable (portable) screening reports that meet statutory criteria.<br/>• ICRAA adverse-action rules apply whenever consumer reports are used. | Enable acceptance of portable screening reports and ensure staff log alternative documentation reviews. Leave credit scoring enabled but monitor the warnings emitted by the compliance engine for voucher files. |
| **New York City, NY** | • Fair Chance for Housing Act (Local Law 24 of 2023) forbids criminal history inquiries until after a conditional offer and bans consideration of sealed, vacated, or non-conviction records.<br/>• NYC Human Rights Law protects lawful source of income; excessive income multiples for subsidy users are treated as discriminatory. | Use the `us-nyc` policy template to cap rent multiples at 2.5× and fully disable criminal history scoring during the application stage. Capture alternative income verification in the underwriting workflow. |
| **Cook County, IL** | • Just Housing Amendment requires a two-step process: prequalification prior to any criminal search and an individualized assessment limited to convictions from the past three years.<br/>• Arrests, sealed, or expunged records may not influence a decision. | Apply the `us-il-cook` policy to zero-out pre-offer criminal scoring. Operational teams must document individualized assessments if post-offer review occurs. |
| **Seattle, WA** | • Seattle Municipal Code 14.09 prohibits asking about or using criminal history (with narrow sex-offender exceptions).<br/>• Local guidance encourages limiting minimum income to ~2.5× rent for subsidy compliance. | Select the `us-wa-seattle` template; it removes criminal scoring entirely and caps affordability thresholds. Ensure adverse action notices focus on income, rental history, or employment evidence. |
| **Portland, OR** | • FAIR Ordinance (PCC 30.01.086) defines “low-barrier” criteria: income multiple capped at 2.5×, no denial for credit scores above 500 when low-barrier is chosen, and strict limits on criminal data older than seven years.<br/>• Landlords must accept alternative evidence of creditworthiness. | Activate the `us-or-portland` policy to align affordability thresholds and to surface warnings about individualized criminal reviews. Staff should record acceptance of alternative credit documentation. |
