## Outcome distribution by proxy group

| Proxy Group | Screened | Approved | Flagged | Denied | False Approvals | False Denials | Manual Review Saves |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HighOpportunityZip | 8 | 6 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| ImmigrantCommunity | 8 | 6 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| LegacyRedlinedZip | 8 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 0 | 2 | 0 |

## Threshold tuning guidance

- False denials (4) exceed false approvals (0). Consider increasing the approval threshold slightly (e.g. +0.25 risk tolerance) to prevent successful tenants from being declined automatically.
- Manual review has intercepted 0 unsuccessful tenancies. Ensure reviewers prioritise these cases to maintain low loss rates.
