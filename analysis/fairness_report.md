# QuickLease Tenant Score Fairness Audit

This report evaluates revised eviction-history scoring alongside credit mitigation options, segmented by protected-class proxy groups.

## Data Set

Historical sample consists of 24 QuickLease applicants with proxy indicators for community type (HighOpportunityZip, LegacyRedlinedZip, ImmigrantCommunity), recorded credit scores, detailed eviction filing outcomes, rental history, employment status, and utility payment reliability.

Current scoring weights, including the credit component, are defined in `src/lib/screeningConfig.ts`.

## Legacy Eviction Penalty

Ignores filing outcomes and only penalizes recorded eviction judgments.

| Proxy Group | Applicants | Approval Rate | Flagged Rate | Denial Rate | Avg Risk Score | Avg Credit Penalty | Disparate Impact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HighOpportunityZip | 8 | 87.5% | 12.5% | 0.0% | 0.88 | 0.38 | 1.00 |
| ImmigrantCommunity | 8 | 62.5% | 37.5% | 0.0% | 3.38 | 1.88 | 0.71 |
| LegacyRedlinedZip | 8 | 25.0% | 25.0% | 50.0% | 7.13 | 1.75 | 0.29 |

Overall approval rate: 58.3%

**Adverse impact alerts (approval rate < 80% of reference group):**
- ImmigrantCommunity: approval rate 62.5% (disparate impact ratio 0.71).
- LegacyRedlinedZip: approval rate 25.0% (disparate impact ratio 0.29).

## Outcome-Sensitive Eviction Scoring (Proposed)

Applies partial credit and time decay based on eviction filing outcomes.

| Proxy Group | Applicants | Approval Rate | Flagged Rate | Denial Rate | Avg Risk Score | Avg Credit Penalty | Disparate Impact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HighOpportunityZip | 8 | 87.5% | 12.5% | 0.0% | 1.04 | 0.38 | 1.00 |
| ImmigrantCommunity | 8 | 50.0% | 50.0% | 0.0% | 3.64 | 1.88 | 0.57 |
| LegacyRedlinedZip | 8 | 12.5% | 25.0% | 62.5% | 6.83 | 1.75 | 0.14 |

Overall approval rate: 50.0%

**Adverse impact alerts (approval rate < 80% of reference group):**
- ImmigrantCommunity: approval rate 50.0% (disparate impact ratio 0.57).
- LegacyRedlinedZip: approval rate 12.5% (disparate impact ratio 0.14).

## Proposed + Reduced Credit Weighting

Pairs the outcome-sensitive eviction scoring with a 50% reduction in credit penalties.

| Proxy Group | Applicants | Approval Rate | Flagged Rate | Denial Rate | Avg Risk Score | Avg Credit Penalty | Disparate Impact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HighOpportunityZip | 8 | 87.5% | 12.5% | 0.0% | 0.85 | 0.19 | 1.00 |
| ImmigrantCommunity | 8 | 50.0% | 50.0% | 0.0% | 2.71 | 0.94 | 0.57 |
| LegacyRedlinedZip | 8 | 25.0% | 25.0% | 50.0% | 5.96 | 0.88 | 0.29 |

Overall approval rate: 54.2%

**Adverse impact alerts (approval rate < 80% of reference group):**
- ImmigrantCommunity: approval rate 50.0% (disparate impact ratio 0.57).
- LegacyRedlinedZip: approval rate 25.0% (disparate impact ratio 0.29).

## Proposed + Utility Payment Adjustment

Retains the outcome-sensitive eviction scoring, moderates credit penalties, and adds offsets for strong utility payment history.

| Proxy Group | Applicants | Approval Rate | Flagged Rate | Denial Rate | Avg Risk Score | Avg Credit Penalty | Disparate Impact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HighOpportunityZip | 8 | 87.5% | 12.5% | 0.0% | 0.45 | 0.19 | 1.00 |
| ImmigrantCommunity | 8 | 75.0% | 25.0% | 0.0% | 1.66 | 1.16 | 0.86 |
| LegacyRedlinedZip | 8 | 25.0% | 25.0% | 50.0% | 5.38 | 1.06 | 0.29 |

Overall approval rate: 62.5%

**Adverse impact alerts (approval rate < 80% of reference group):**
- LegacyRedlinedZip: approval rate 25.0% (disparate impact ratio 0.29).

## Comparative Insights

- Applying outcome-sensitive eviction scoring introduces penalties for dismissed or settled filings, lowering LegacyRedlinedZip disparate impact from 0.29 to 0.14; mitigation is required before rollout.
- Layering reduced credit penalties on the proposed eviction scoring improves ImmigrantCommunity parity to 0.57 while keeping approvals near 50.0% â†’ 54.2%.
- Utility adjustments further cut average risk for applicants with strong payment reliability, yet LegacyRedlinedZip remains below the 0.80 threshold (disparate impact 0.29).

## Recommendations

- Only adopt the outcome-sensitive eviction scoring with accompanying fairness guardrails, given the disparate impact observed on LegacyRedlinedZip applicants.
- Pilot the reduced-credit and utility adjustments in tandem to offset the added eviction penalties while monitoring risk exposure.
- Continue monitoring approval ratios quarterly and flag any proxy group that drops below a 0.80 disparate impact ratio.
