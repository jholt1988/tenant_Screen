# QuickLease Tenant Score Fairness Audit

This report quantifies the effect of credit weighting on applicant outcomes segmented by protected-class proxy groups and compares mitigation options.

## Data Set

Historical sample consists of 24 QuickLease applicants with proxy indicators for community type (HighOpportunityZip, LegacyRedlinedZip, ImmigrantCommunity), recorded credit scores, rental history, employment status, and utility payment reliability.

Current scoring weights, including the credit component, are defined in `src/lib/screeningConfig.ts`.

## Baseline – Current Weights

Production QuickLease credit scoring weights (0 / 1 / 2 points).

| Proxy Group | Applicants | Approval Rate | Flagged Rate | Denial Rate | Avg Risk Score | Avg Credit Penalty | Disparate Impact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HighOpportunityZip | 8 | 87.5% | 12.5% | 0.0% | 0.88 | 0.38 | 1.00 |
| ImmigrantCommunity | 8 | 62.5% | 37.5% | 0.0% | 3.38 | 1.88 | 0.71 |
| LegacyRedlinedZip | 8 | 25.0% | 25.0% | 50.0% | 7.13 | 1.75 | 0.29 |

Overall approval rate: 58.3%

**Adverse impact alerts (approval rate < 80% of reference group):**
- ImmigrantCommunity: approval rate 62.5% (disparate impact ratio 0.71).
- LegacyRedlinedZip: approval rate 25.0% (disparate impact ratio 0.29).

## Reduced Credit Weighting (50% penalty)

Halves the credit penalties to lessen their contribution to the total risk score.

| Proxy Group | Applicants | Approval Rate | Flagged Rate | Denial Rate | Avg Risk Score | Avg Credit Penalty | Disparate Impact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HighOpportunityZip | 8 | 87.5% | 12.5% | 0.0% | 0.69 | 0.19 | 1.00 |
| ImmigrantCommunity | 8 | 75.0% | 25.0% | 0.0% | 2.44 | 0.94 | 0.86 |
| LegacyRedlinedZip | 8 | 25.0% | 37.5% | 37.5% | 6.25 | 0.88 | 0.29 |

Overall approval rate: 62.5%

**Adverse impact alerts (approval rate < 80% of reference group):**
- LegacyRedlinedZip: approval rate 25.0% (disparate impact ratio 0.29).

## Credit + Utility Payment Adjustment

Moderate credit penalties while granting offsets for strong utility payment history and mild surcharges for low payment reliability.

| Proxy Group | Applicants | Approval Rate | Flagged Rate | Denial Rate | Avg Risk Score | Avg Credit Penalty | Disparate Impact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HighOpportunityZip | 8 | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.38 | 0.19 | 1.00 |
| ImmigrantCommunity | 8 | 75.0% | 25.0% | 0.0% | 1.47 | 1.16 | 0.75 |
| LegacyRedlinedZip | 8 | 25.0% | 37.5% | 37.5% | 5.69 | 1.06 | 0.25 |

Overall approval rate: 66.7%

**Adverse impact alerts (approval rate < 80% of reference group):**
- ImmigrantCommunity: approval rate 75.0% (disparate impact ratio 0.75).
- LegacyRedlinedZip: approval rate 25.0% (disparate impact ratio 0.25).

## Comparative Insights

- Baseline weights show the strongest disparate impact, with approval ratios for LegacyRedlinedZip and ImmigrantCommunity groups falling below the 0.80 threshold (0.29 and 0.71 respectively).
- Reducing credit penalties boosts ImmigrantCommunity parity to 0.86 while maintaining similar approval throughput (58.3% → 62.5%); LegacyRedlinedZip remains constrained (0.29).
- Utility adjustments decrease average risk scores and widen access for applicants with strong payment histories, yet LegacyRedlinedZip still trails at a 0.25 disparate impact ratio, signaling the need for additional policy levers beyond credit data.

## Recommendations

- Adopt the utility-adjusted weighting in a controlled pilot to validate sustained fairness gains without materially increasing risk.
- Expand data collection on alternative credit indicators (utility, rental payment history) to support robust scoring beyond traditional credit bureaus.
- Continue monitoring approval ratios quarterly and flag any proxy group that drops below a 0.80 disparate impact ratio.
