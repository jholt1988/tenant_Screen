# Threshold Recalibration Summary

Validation data of 24 screened tenancies was used to calibrate decision thresholds against recorded outcomes.

## Baseline decision policy

- Approved ≤ **3.00** risk, Flagged ≤ **6.00** risk (else denied)
- Misclassifications: **9.50** (false positives: 0, false negatives: 9)
- Successful tenancies flagged for review: 6, unsuccessful tenancies held for review: 1

## Calibrated policy (validation-driven)

- Approved ≤ **5.50**, Flagged ≤ **5.75**
- Misclassifications: **3.00** (false positives: 0, false negatives: 3)
- Successful tenancies flagged: 0, unsuccessful tenancies held: 0

## Impact

- Total misclassifications reduced by **6.50** (68.4% improvement).
- False denials reduced by 6, false approvals reduced by 0.
- Adjusted thresholds keep manual reviews targeted (unsuccessful reviews vs successful reviews ratio improved).

These thresholds should be applied in production and monitored monthly alongside fairness reports to ensure stability.
